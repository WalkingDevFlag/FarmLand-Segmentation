# FarmLand-Segmentation


Farmland Segmentation is a computer vision task that involves identifying and delineating agricultural land from satellite or aerial imagery. This task is crucial for various applications, such as precision agriculture, crop monitoring, land use planning, and policy decision-making.

In this project, I aim to train and evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning models for the task of Farmland Segmentation. The models I will be training are:

1. **Detectron 2**
2. **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**
3. **YOLO v8 / v9**

## Model Overviews

### Detectron 2
- Detectron 2 is an open-source object detection and segmentation library developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). It is a state-of-the-art model for instance segmentation and is known for its high accuracy and efficiency.
- I have successfully trained a Detectron 2 model for Farmland Segmentation using a larger dataset and a more powerful GPU. The model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the task and is ready for deployment in real-world applications.

### Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a recently released model by Anthropic that can generate segmentation masks for any given image and prompts. It is a versatile model that can be used for various segmentation tasks, including farmland segmentation.

### YOLO v8 / v9
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system that is known for its speed and accuracy. YOLO v8 and v9 are the latest versions of this model, which offer improved performance and features compared to previous versions.
